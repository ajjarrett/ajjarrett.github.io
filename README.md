This project visualizes the number of medals each nation won at each Olympic Games held between the years of 2000-2022. This project is written using only the D3 JavaScript library.

This visualization uses data from https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/tokyo-2020/medals to collect the medal count by nation for different years of the Olympics Games. The data was copied from the olympics.com website to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, where it was then exported as a csv.  A python script was used to process the data into a usable format.  The data is available in the folder 'olympics_data' of this repository.
